# Loan Dataset Analysis with Databricks

This project demonstrates a basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the well-known Loan Dataset, [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanishaj225/loancsv), using Databricks. The goal of this project is to showcase the capabilities and usability of Databricks.

## Project Overview

In this project, I used the Databricks Community Edition to:
- Perform an EDA on the Loan Dataset.
- Explore the data using Databricks SQL.
- Create visualizations and insights directly within the Databricks notebook environment.

All source files, including the `.dbc` notebook and the exact dataset used, are included in this repository for future reference.

## How to Replicate

To replicate this analysis:
1. Go to your Databricks account.
2. Import the notebook using the `.dbc` file provided in this repository. This will allow you to see the visualizations and SQL queries used in the analysis.
3. Upload the `.csv` file to your Databricks workspace and create a table from it. This step is necessary to re-run the notebook and replicate the analysis.

## Files in this Repository
- **Toy project - Analyzing Loans.dbc**: Databricks notebook containing the EDA and SQL queries.
- **Toy project - Analyzing Loans.sql**: SQL source file of the notebook.
- **loan.csv**: The dataset used for the analysis.

## Notes
- This project was conducted using Databricks Community Edition, which provides free access to Databricks functionalities. Feel free to use the notebook and dataset to explore and modify the analysis according to your needs.
